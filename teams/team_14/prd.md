# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Instructions:** This is your team's project specification. Fill in the sections below to define what you're building.

---

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** *[Give your project a name]*

**One-line Description:** *[What does it do in one sentence?]*

**Type:** *[e.g., Chrome Extension, Web App, CLI Tool, etc.]*

---

## Guidelines

### Keep It Small!

- Your MVP should be buildable in **10 minutes** by one person
- Think "proof of concept" not "production ready"
- If it sounds ambitious, make it simpler
- **Use Cursor to help you plan this!** You need a project that has at least 5 features so everyone on your team can pick one and add it
- Feel free to take one of the ideas below — this exercise is about learning the git flow, collaborating as a team, and understanding where Cursor's features fit into the SDLC

### Good Project Ideas

**Pong** — classic paddle-and-ball game

- *Example features:* scoreboard, sound effects, difficulty/speed settings

**Memory Card Match** — flip cards to find matching pairs

- *Example features:* move counter, timer, win animation/confetti

**Drawing Pad** — simple canvas you can sketch on

- *Example features:* color picker, brush size slider, eraser tool

**Typing Speed Game** — type a passage and measure your words per minute

- *Example features:* WPM display, accuracy tracker, difficulty levels

**Trivia Quiz** — multiple choice questions with score tracking

- *Example features:* timer per question, category selector, results summary screen

### Bad Project Ideas (Too Big!)

- Anything with a database -- tell cursor to avoid this
- Anything requiring authentication
- Anything with multiple pages/screens
- Anything that "needs" an API

## Team Members & Tasks

> **Important:** Each team member MUST have their own task. Tasks should be independent features that can be built in parallel without stepping on each other's toes.


| Name       | Task          | Description           |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| *[Name 1]* | *[Feature 1]* | *[Brief description]* |
| *[Name 2]* | *[Feature 2]* | *[Brief description]* |
| *[Name 3]* | *[Feature 3]* | *[Brief description]* |
| *[Name 4]* | *[Feature 4]* | *[Brief description]* |
| *[Name 5]* | *[Feature 5]* | *[Brief description]* |


### Task Guidelines

- Each task should add something **visible** to the project
- Tasks should be **independent** — no dependencies on other tasks
- Think: new button, new section, new color scheme, new text, etc.
- Everyone should be able to work at the same time without conflicts

## Base MVP (Phase 2)

> **One person** creates the foundation that everyone else builds on.

**What the MVP includes:**

- *[Describe the minimal working version]*

**What it does NOT include:**

- *[List features deliberately left out for team members to add]*

---

## Feature Slots (Phase 3)

> These are the features team members will add. Design them to be **independent** so people can work in parallel.

### Feature 1: *[Name]*

- **Assigned to:** *[Team member]*
- **Description:** *[What it does]*
- **Files to modify/create:** *[Be specific]*

### Feature 2: *[Name]*

- **Assigned to:** *[Team member]*
- **Description:** *[What it does]*
- **Files to modify/create:** *[Be specific]*

### Feature 3: *[Name]*

- **Assigned to:** *[Team member]*
- **Description:** *[What it does]*
- **Files to modify/create:** *[Be specific]*

### Feature 4: *[Name]*

- **Assigned to:** *[Team member]*
- **Description:** *[What it does]*
- **Files to modify/create:** *[Be specific]*

### Feature 5: *[Name]*

- **Assigned to:** *[Team member]*
- **Description:** *[What it does]*
- **Files to modify/create:** *[Be specific]*

## Success Criteria

- MVP runs locally
- Each team member has merged at least one PR
- All features work together without breaking the app
